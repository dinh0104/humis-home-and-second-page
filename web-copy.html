                <h1>Dean L. Fellowship</h1>
                <p>Thanks to the generosity of several large donors, including the George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Foundation, along with the support of scores of former students, colleagues, and friends, the Dean L. May Graduate Fellowship in the History of Utah and the American West has become a reality.
                    Under the terms of the fellowship, Dean May Fellows will receive $15,000 plus tuition per year during their first two years of graduate study. In the first year, the fellowship includes no teaching obligations; in their second year, fellows will serve as Teaching Assistants in the department.
                    With gifts from more than sixty individuals and foundations, the History Department has raised more than half of the $350,000 it seeks to support the Dean May Fellowship in perpetuity.
                    In the meantime, this fall the first Dean May Fellow will begin graduate study in the Department of History. James Seaman graduated summa cum laude from the University of Utah in 2001 with degrees in History and Political Science. Since that time, he has worked for the Department of Consumer Affairs in New York and has taught middle school in the South Bronx through the Teach for America program. He has a strong interest in the history of the American Southwest, particularly the shift of population and industry to the Sunbelt states in the last half of the 20th century. One faculty reader of his application file commented, “James Seaman has the potential to be one of our best graduate students.” The Dean L. May Graduate Fellowship has made it possible for the History Department to recruit James to our program and generously support his course of study.
                    We continue to seek support for this endowment. We are actively soliciting foundations and individuals with a particular interest in this area, and we welcome unsolicited gifts as well. If you would like to support this fellowship, please click here for more information.</p>
